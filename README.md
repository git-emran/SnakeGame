🐍 Snake Game

Welcome to the classic Snake Game — now with 100% more Python and 0% actual snakes (I checked). Whether you’re here to relive some retro gaming nostalgia or just to see how long you can last before running into your own tail, you’re in the right place.

🎮 Features
	•	Classic Gameplay: Guide your snake, eat the food, grow longer, and avoid self-destruction (life lessons included).
	•	Pure Python: No exotic dependencies—just the power of Python and a bit of nostalgia.
	•	Simple Controls: Arrow keys to steer, quick reflexes to survive.
	•	Score Tracking: Because bragging rights matter.

🚀 Getting Started
	1.	Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/git-emran/SnakeGame.git
cd SnakeGame

	2.	Install requirements (if any):pip install -r requirements.txt
(If there’s no requirements.txt, just skip this step—less is more.)
	3.	Run the game:python snake.py

	4.	Enjoy! Try to beat your high score, but remember: the snake always wins in the end.

🕹️ Controls
	•	Arrow Keys: Move the snake (up, down, left, right)
	•	Q: Quit the game (for when you need a snack break)

📦 Files
	•	‎⁠snake.py⁠ – The main event. All the game logic lives here.
